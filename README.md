# el Racó Dark Mode
*I want to study, not to get blind ~ Me, 2023*

This is an attempt at restyling `el Racó` to match (my) modern standards with UserCSS. You can install it too, but I'm not responsible
for web designer tears nor broken layouts.

# Building
```sh
npm install
npm run build
```
You will find the UserCSS file in the root of the project.

# Installation
1. Install [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) in your browser
2. Open `main.user.css` with your browser
3. Click the *Install style* button
4. Profit!
